library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
plastic_waste <- read.csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

First plots are histograms of the distribution of plastic waste per capita faceted by continent.

Second plot is the same data as a density plot.

```{r plastic-waste-continent}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  #To make them one graph by color, add in fill = continent after plastice_waste_per_cap
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) + facet_wrap(~continent)
plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)



ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)

```
What I can tell is that they all look pretty similar in terms of plastic waste per capita. North America has a singular outlier which makes the graph all look the same.

### Exercise 2

```{r plastic-waste-density}
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.1)

```

We use color and fill for aesthetics because they are tied to a variable (continent). This allows for the color to change with each variable and show multiple colors. Density is universal and not tied to a variable.
