## Exercises

### Exercise 1

First plots are histograms of the distribution of plastic waste per
capita faceted by continent.

Second plot is the same data as a density plot.

``` r
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  #To make them one graph by color, add in fill = continent after plastice_waste_per_cap
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2) + facet_wrap(~continent)
```

    ## (`stat_bin()`).

``` r
plastic_waste %>%
  filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)
```

  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7)

I can tell is that they all look pretty similar in terms of plastic
waste per capita. North America has a singular outlier which makes the
graph all look the same.

### Exercise 2

``` r
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
    color = continent,
    fill = continent
  )
) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.1)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range
    ## (`stat_density()`).

![](lab-02_files/figure-gfm/plastic-waste-density-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
#plot side by side
ggplot(
  data = plastic_waste,
  mapping = aes(
    x = continent,
    y = plastic_waste_per_cap
  )
) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 51 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range
    ## (`stat_boxplot()`).

We use color and fill for aesthetics because they are tied to a variable
(continent). This allows for the color to change with each variable and
show multiple colors. Density is universal and not tied to a variable.
